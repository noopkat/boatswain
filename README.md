"Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,  
Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power –  
Who knows thee well must quit thee with disgust,  
Degraded mass of animated dust!  
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,  
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!  
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,  
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.  
Ye, who behold perchance this simple urn,  
Pass on – it honours none you wish to mourn.  
To mark a friend’s remains these stones arise;  
I never knew but one -- and here he lies."  

_Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog_
