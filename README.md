boatswain
=========

"Near this spot are deposited the remains of one who  
possessed Beauty without Vanity,  
Strength without Insolence,  
Courage without Ferocity,  
and all the Virtues of Man,  
without his Vices.  
This Praise, which would be unmeaning  
Flattery if inscribed over human  
ashes is but a just tribute to the Memory  
of Boatswain, a Dog."  

_Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog_  
by Lord Byron
